Each CSV file provides RCC and QTC groundtruth relations in addition to the object bounding boxes.

Columns of CSV files are given in this order:
- frame number.
- RCC.
- QTC.
- bounding boxes.

- RCC starts from the first frame in the video whereas QTC starts from the second frame.

- A QTC relation at the i-th frame describes the trajectory between (i-1)- and i-th frames.
